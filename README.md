EmbryoMotion 1.1
EmbryoMotion was designed to evaluate zebrafish embryo early stage videos for the assessment of two types of embryonic movements â€“ spontaneous tail contraction (STC) and photomotor response (PMR). The software particularly allows to analyse videos from microplate wells with rectangular shapes (96 wells) or round wells (24 wells). Other formats may be detected as well but have not been tested. Videos with too low (week sensitivity) or too high (computationally demanding) resolution could be difficult to analyse.
Example videos that will work: 30-60 sec videos recorded with the Viewpoint Zebrabox system. AVI format with no compression (approx.. 6 GB size).
A detailed manual and a license is provided.
Please note that the software should be considered as under development.
Known issues and required improvements:
-	More flexible identification of well plate and dish formats is needed.
-	Embryo tracking: Contraction of embryos can result in moving them out of the area that is used for quantification. A combination with a track of the embryo region could help in the future. You can also increase the area around the embryo to compensate for slight movements.
-	Association with layout file: Only layouts with one test chemical in different concentrations are accepted. Workaround for screen different chemicals and numbers: Assign an arbitrary number to each sample.
